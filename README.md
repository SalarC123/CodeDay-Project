## Checklist

- [ ] Format the website 
- [ ] User login - I don't know if we'll have time for that before CodeDay ends, but we can add it afterwards
- [ ] Create code for flashcards, tests, notes, schedule, brain breaks, goals, and to-do lsit pages
- [ ] Come up with name and logo of site (I have one in the images folder already, but we can do something else)
- [ ] Deployment on Heroku
- [ ] And more...
